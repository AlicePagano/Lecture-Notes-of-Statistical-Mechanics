## Folder Organization

The code of the notes is organized in multiple directories as:

* Bibliography: in this directory I stored the `.tex` subfile for the bibliography.
* Frontpage: `.tex` subfile for the frontpage of the notes.
* Arguments: each arguments has it's own chapter and `.tex` subfile.
* Utility: contains `.tex` files for packages, settings and new commands.
* Main: `.tex` file for the full document.
