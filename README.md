## Folder Organization

The code of the notes is organized in multiple directories as:

* bibliography: in this directory I stored the .Tex subfile for the bibliography.
* frontespizio: .Tex subfile for the cover of the notes.
* lessons: each lesson is organized in subfile.
* macro: contains .Tex files for packages, settings and new commands.
* main: .Tex file for the full document.
