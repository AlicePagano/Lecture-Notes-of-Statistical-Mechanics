# Lectures-Statistical-Mechanics

Lectures notes of the Master degree course "Statistical Mechanics" of professor Enzo Orlandini at the University of Padua (Academic Year 2019/2020).

The topics in the document are organized as follows:

* Recall of Thermodynamics
* Equilibrium phases and thermodynamics of phase transitions
* Recall of statistical mechanics and theory of ensembles
* Statistical mechanics and phase transitions
* Role of the models in statistical mechanics
* Some exactly solvable models of phase transitions
* The role of dimension, symmetry and range of interactions in phase transitions
* Mean field theories of phase transitions and variational mean field
* Non ideal fluids: Mean field theory, Van der Walls, Virial expansion and Cluster expansion
* Landau theory of phase transition for homogeneous systems
* Role of fluctuations in critical phenomena: Ginzburg criterium, Coarse-graining and Ginzburg-Landau theory of phase transitions
*  Widom’s scaling theory. Block-spin Kadanoff’s transformation
* Renormalization group theory. Universality
* Spontaneous symmetry breaking

The code of the notes is organized in multiple directories as:
* bibliography: in this directory I stored the .Tex subfile for the bibliography.
* frontespizio: .Tex subfile for the cover of the notes.
* lessons: each lesson is organized in subfile.
* macro: contains .Tex files for packages, settings and new commands.
* main: .Tex file for the full document.
